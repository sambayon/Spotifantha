Data visualization and analysis of Spotify top songs

Since the popularity arise of TikTok and other video sharing apps, new music's being discovered by this means.
Considering that these clips are short there's some questions we naturally make ourselves: is the algorithm influencing music popularity? are hit songs shorter? is there a relation to be made between the tempo and beat of today's top hits? is there a link between latin music with Spanish vocal's popularity in the United States these recent years with the rise of social media?

Those were my inquiries, so this little hobby project of mine still in progress is a way to answer or, at least, arrive to more observations about these matter?.

So which are you top 10 songs of the year?
